    </header><p>Back at school. I made it into the UC Davis Jazz Ensembles despite completely missing auditions. But the band director has heard me play before, so at the very least he knows I&rsquo;m not absolute garbage. Anyway, this means I&rsquo;ve got to go to in-person rehearsals. We&rsquo;ve got a concert coming up at the end of the quarter. And I&rsquo;m rusty as hell at jazz drumming. Plus I got a cut on my left thumb from a super sharp scalpel and the bandage makes it hard to do rolls. I sliced my thumb open trying to open a jar of peanut butter. Don&rsquo;t ask. Not my proudest moment.</p>
<p>Still working on the site(s). It&rsquo;s still fun. But I&rsquo;m running out of time. Life is speeding up and I&rsquo;m struggling to keep pace.</p>
<p>Got results from a COVID-19 test yesterday. Negative. I think I&rsquo;m just built different. I&rsquo;ve been exposed multiple times to multiple people who tested positive. I&rsquo;m still negative. <del>Fuck a virus fr on god on 2 virgils keepin it a buck fifty imma wipe a viruses nose if it comes down to it</del></p>
<p>Alright. I&rsquo;m done here. Peace out. I&rsquo;ll get back to writing here someday, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
